# Tanstack-Promptopia
This project is an extremely minimalistic implementation of Promptopia, a project introduced by Adrian Hajdin in this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm5gMKuwSYk&t=2569s).
My only motivation behind building this project is to learn the fundamentals of **Contentful CMS** and Tanstack Query. For this reason, things like responsive UI and authentication were not focused on.
